Quick update: list of OP-Z sound engines / plugs

Hi there, just a quick update to let you know that i have compiled a list of know (or less known) internal OP-Z engines and corresponding plugs in the [https://github.com/lrk/z-po-project/](Z-PO Project github repository).

Feel free to contribute to this document/repository and/or create a github issue if there is something inaccurate !

Share the knowledge !
