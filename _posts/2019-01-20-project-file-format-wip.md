Quick update: OP-Z File format WIP

Hi there, just a quick update to let you know that i have compiled some informations about the OP-Z file format (.opz) in the [Z-PO Project github repository](https://github.com/lrk/z-po-project/).

Feel free to contribute to this document/repository and/or create a github issue if there is something inaccurate !

Share the knowledge !
