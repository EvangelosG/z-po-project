Quick update: OP-Z File format completed (almost)

Hi there, just a quick update to let you know that i have complete almost all the OP-Z file format (.opz) in the [Z-PO Project github repository](https://github.com/lrk/z-po-project/).

There is around 48 bytes i still don't understand but now it's fully useable.

Feel free to contribute to this document/repository and/or create a github issue if there is something inaccurate !

Share the knowledge !
